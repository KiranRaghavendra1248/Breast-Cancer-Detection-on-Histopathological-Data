2022 Fourth International Conference on Emerging Research in Electronics, Computer Science and Technology (ICERECT)
<ul>
<li>Trained prominent CNN architectures ResNet50, AlexNet, and GoogleNet on BreakHis dataset from scratch
<li>Training was done by utlizing various image processing techniques such as Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Image sharpening and Edge enhancement
<li>The optimum model amongst the proposed i.e. Resnet50 + Image Sharpening achieved an accuracy of 95%
